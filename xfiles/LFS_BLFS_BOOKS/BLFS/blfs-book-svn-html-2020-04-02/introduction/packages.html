      </h1>
      <p>
        Within the BLFS instructions, each package has two references for
        finding the source files for the package&mdash;an HTTP link and an
        FTP link (some packages may only list one of these links). Every
        effort has been made to ensure that these links are accurate.
        However, the World Wide Web is in continuous flux. Packages are
        sometimes moved or updated and the exact URL specified is not always
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        To overcome this problem, the BLFS Team, with the assistance of
        Oregon State University Open Source Lab, has made an HTTP/FTP site
        available through world wide mirrors. See <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/download.html#sources">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/download.html#sources</a>
        for a list. These sites have all the sources of the exact versions of
        the packages used in BLFS. If you can't find the BLFS package you
        need at the listed addresses, get it from these sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to ask a favor, however. Although this is a public
        resource for you to use, please do not abuse it. We have already had
        one unthinking individual download over 3 GB of data, including
        multiple copies of the same files that are placed at different
        locations (via symlinks) to make finding the right package easier.
        This person clearly did not know what files he needed and downloaded
        everything. The best place to download files is the site or sites set
        up by the source code developer. Please try there first.
