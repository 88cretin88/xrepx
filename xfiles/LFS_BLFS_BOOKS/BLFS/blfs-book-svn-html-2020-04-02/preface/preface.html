      </h1>
      <p>
        Having helped out with Linux From Scratch for a short time, I noticed
        that we were getting many queries as to how to do things beyond the
        base LFS system. At the time, the only assistance specifically
        offered relating to LFS were the LFS hints (<a class="ulink" href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints</a>).
        Most of the LFS hints are extremely good and well written but I (and
        others) could still see a need for more comprehensive help to go
        Beyond LFS &mdash; hence BLFS.
      </p>
      <p>
        BLFS aims to be more than the LFS-hints converted to XML although
        much of our work is based around the hints and indeed some authors
        write both hints and the relevant BLFS sections. We hope that we can
        provide you with enough information to not only manage to build your
        system up to what you want, whether it be a web server or a
        multimedia desktop system, but also that you will learn a lot about
        system configuration as you go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks as ever go to everyone in the LFS/BLFS community; especially
        those who have contributed instructions, written text, answered
        questions and generally shouted when things were wrong!
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we encourage you to become involved in the community; ask
        questions on the mailing list or news gateway and join in the fun on
        #lfs and #lfs-support at freenode. You can find more details about
        all of these in the <a class="xref" href=
        "../introduction/introduction.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Introduction">Introduction</a> section of the
        book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enjoy using BLFS.

        I still remember how I found the BLFS project and started using the
        instructions that were completed at the time. I could not believe how
        wonderful it was to get an application up and running very quickly,
        with explanations as to why things were done a certain way.
        Unfortunately, for me, it wasn't long before I was opening
        applications that had nothing more than "To be done" on the page. I
        did what most would do, I waited for someone else to do it. It wasn't
        too long before I am looking through <span class=
        "application">Bugzilla</span> for something easy to do. As with any
        learning experience, the definition of what was easy kept changing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We still encourage you to become involved as BLFS is never really
        finished. Contributing or just using, we hope you enjoy your BLFS
        experience.

        The BLFS project is a natural progression of LFS. Together, these
        projects provide a unique resource for the Open Source Community.
        They take the mystery out of the process of building a complete,
        functional software system from the source code contributed by many
        talented individuals throughout the world. They truly allow users to
        implement the slogan <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
        "quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Your distro, your
        rules</em></span></span>&rdquo;</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to continue to provide the best resource available that
        shows you how to integrate many significant Open Source applications.
        Since these applications are constantly updated and new applications
        are developed, this book will never be complete. Additionally, there
        is always room for improvement in explaining the nuances of how to
        install the different packages. To make these improvements, we need
        your feedback. I encourage you to participate on the different
        mailing lists, news groups, and IRC channels to help meet these
        goals.

        My introduction to the [B]LFS project was actually by accident. I was
        trying to build a <span class="application">GNOME</span> environment
        using some how-tos and other information I found on the web. A couple
        of times I ran into some build issues and Googling pulled up some old
        BLFS mailing list messages. Out for curiosity, I visited the Linux
        From Scratch web site and shortly thereafter was hooked. I've not
        used any other Linux distribution for personal use since.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can't promise anyone will feel the sense of satisfaction I felt
        after building my first few systems using [B]LFS instructions, but I
        sincerely hope that your BLFS experience is as rewarding for you as
        it has been for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The BLFS project has grown significantly the last couple of years.
        There are more package instructions and related dependencies than
        ever before. The project requires your input for continued success.
        If you discover that you enjoy building BLFS, please consider helping
        out in any way you can. BLFS requires hundreds of hours of
        maintenance to keep it even semi-current. If you feel confident
        enough in your editing skills, please consider joining the BLFS team.
        Simply contributing to the mailing list discussions with sound advice
        and/or providing patches to the book's XML will probably result in
        you receiving an invitation to join the team.
