      <p>
        An LFS system can be used without a graphical desktop, and unless or
        until you install <a class="xref" href="../x/installing.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;24.&nbsp;X Window System Environment">X Window
        System</a> you will have to work in the console. Most, if not all,
        PCs boot with an 8x16 font - whatever the actual screen size. There
        are a few things you can do to alter the display on the console. Most
        of them involve changing the font, but the first alters the
        commandline used by grub.

          <a id="grub-video" name="grub-video"></a>Setting a smaller screen
          size in grub
        </h2>
        <p>
          Modern screens often have a lot more pixels then the screens used
          in the past. If your screen is 1600 pixels wide, an 8x16 font will
          give you 200 columns of text - unless your monitor is enormous, the
          text will be tiny. One of the ways to work around this is to tell
          grub to use a smaller size, such as 1024x768 or 800x600 or even
          640x480. Even if your screen does not have a 4:3 aspect ratio, this
          should work.
        </p>
        <p>
          To try this, you can reboot and edit grub's command-line to insert
          a 'video=' parameter between the 'root=/dev/sdXn' and 'ro', for
          example <code class="literal">root=/dev/sda2 video=1024x768
          ro</code> based on the example in LFS section 8.4.4 : <span class=
          "phrase"><a class="ulink" href=
          "../../../../lfs/view/9.1/chapter08/grub.html">../../../../lfs/view/9.1/chapter08/grub.html</a></span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          If you decide that you wish to do this, you can then (as the
          <code class="systemitem">root</code> user) edit <code class=
          "filename">/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code>.

          <a id="psf-fonts" name="psf-fonts"></a>Using the standard psf fonts
        </h2>
        <p>
          In LFS the <span class="application">kbd</span> package is used.
          The fonts it provides are PC Screen Fonts, usually called PSF, and
          they were installed into <code class=
          "filename">/usr/share/consolefonts</code>. Where these include a
          unicode mapping table, the file suffix is often changed to
          <code class="literal">.psfu</code> although packages such as
          <span class="application">terminus-font</span> (see below) do not
          add the 'u'. These fonts are usually compressed with gzip to save
          space, but that is not essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial PC text screens had 8 colours, or 16 colours if the
          bright versions of the original 8 colours were used. A PSF font can
          include up to 256 characters (technically, glyphs) while allowing
          16 colours, or up to 512 characters (in which case, the bright
          colours will not be available). Clearly, these console fonts cannot
          be used to display CJK text - that would need thousands of
          available glyphs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some fonts in <span class="application">kbd</span> can cover more
          than 512 codepoints ('characters'), with varying degrees of
          fidelity: unicode contains several whitespace codepoints which can
          all be mapped to a space, varieties of dashes can be mapped to a
          minus sign, smart quotes can map to the regular ASCII quotes rather
          than to whatever is used for "codepoint not present or invalid",
          and those cyrillic or greek letters which look like latin letters
          can be mapped onto them, so 'A' can also do duty for cyrillic A and
          greek Alpha, and 'P' can also do duty for cyrillic ER and greek
          RHO. Unfortunately, where a font has been created from a BDF file
          (the method in terminus and debian's <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://packages.debian.org/jessie/utils/console-setup">console-setup</a>
          ) such mapping of additional codepoints onto an existing glyph is
          not always done, although the terminus ter-vXXn fonts do this well.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are over 120 combinations of font and size in <span class=
          "application">kbd</span>: often a font is provided at several
          character sizes, and sometimes varieties cover different subsets of
          unicode. Most are 8 pixels wide, in heights from 8 to 16 pixels,
          but there are a few which are 9 pixels wide, some others which are
          12x22, and even one (<code class=
          "filename">latarcyrheb-sun32.psfu</code>) which has been scaled up
          to 16x32. Using a bigger font is another way of making text on a
          large screen easier to read.

          fonts
        </h2>
        <p>
          You can test fonts as a normal user. If you have a font which has
          not been installed, you can load it with :
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">setfont /path/to/yourfont.ext</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          For the fonts already installed you only need the name, so using
          <code class="filename">gr737a-9x16.psfu.gz</code> as an example:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">setfont gr737a-9x16</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          To see the glyphs in the font, use:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">showconsolefont</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          If the font looks as if it might be useful, you can then go on to
          test it more thoroughly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you find a font which you wish to use, as the <code class=
          "systemitem">root</code> user) edit <span class=
          "phrase"><code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/console</code> as
          described in LFS section 7.6.5 <a class="ulink" href=
          "../../../../lfs/view/9.1/chapter07/usage.html">../../../../lfs/view/9.1/chapter07/usage.html</a>.</span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          For fonts not supplied with the <span class=
          "application">kbd</span> package you will need to optionally
          compress it / them with <span class=
          "command"><strong>gzip</strong></span> and then install it / them
          as the <code class="systemitem">root</code> user.

        <p>
          Although some console fonts are created from BDF files, which is a
          text format with hex values for the pixels in each row of the
          character, there are more-modern tools available for editing psf
          fonts. The <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.seasip.info/Unix/PSF/">psftools</a> package allows you
          to dump a font to a text representation with a dash for a pixel
          which is off (black) and a hash for a pixel which is on (white).
          You can then edit the text file to add more characters, or reshape
          them, or map extra codepoints onto them, and then create a new psf
          font with your changes.

          Terminus-font
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/">Terminus Font</a> package
          provides fixed-width bitmap fonts designed for long (8 hours and
          more per day) work with computers. Under 'Character variants' on
          that page is a list of patches (in the <code class=
          "filename">alt/</code> directory). If you are using a graphical
          browser to look at that page, you can see what the patches do, e.g.
          'll2' makes 'l' more visibly different from 'i' and '1'.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default <span class="application">terminus-fonts</span> will try
          to create several types of font, and it will fail if <span class=
          "command"><strong>bdftopcf</strong></span> from <a class="xref"
          href="../x/x7app.html" title="Xorg Applications">Xorg
          Applications</a> has not been installed. The configure script is
          only really useful if you go on to install <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the fonts (console and X11 bitmap)
          to the correct directories, as in a distro. To build only the PSF
          fonts and their dependencies, run:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">make psf</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          This will create more than 240 ter-*.psf fonts. The 'b' suffix
          indicates bright, 'n' indicates normal. You can then test them to
          see if any fit your requirements. Unless you are creating a distro,
          there seems little point in installing them all.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, to install the last of these fonts, you can gzip it
          and then as the <code class="systemitem">root</code> user:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class=
"command">install -v -m644 ter-v32n.psf.gz /usr/share/consolefonts</kbd>
