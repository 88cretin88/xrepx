      <p>
        This book is divided into the following parts.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part I - Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This part contains information which is essential to the rest of the
        book.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part II - Post LFS Configuration and Extra Software
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here we introduce basic configuration and security issues. We also
        discuss a range of editors, file systems, and shells which aren't
        covered in the main LFS book.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part III - General Libraries and Utilities
      </h2>
      <p>
        In this section we cover libraries which are often needed by the rest
        of the book as well as system utilities. Information on Programming
        (including recompiling <span class="application">GCC</span> to
        support its full range of languages) concludes this part.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part IV - Basic Networking
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here we cover how to connect to a network when you aren't using the
        simple static IP setup given in the main LFS book. Networking
        libraries and command-line networking tools are also covered here.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part V - Servers
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here we deal with setting up mail and other servers (such as
        <span class="application">SSH</span>, <span class=
        "application">Apache</span>, etc.).
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part VI - X + Window Managers
      </h2>
      <p>
        This part explains how to set up a basic <span class="application">X
        Window System</span> installation along with some generic
        <span class="application">X</span> libraries and Window managers.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part VII - KDE
      </h2>
      <p>
        For those who want to use the <span class="application">K Desktop
        Environment</span> or some parts of it, this part covers it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part VIII - GNOME
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span class="application">GNOME</span> is the main alternative to
        <span class="application">KDE</span> in the Desktop Environment
        arena.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part IX - Xfce
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span class="application">Xfce</span> is a lightweight alternative to
        <span class="application">GNOME</span> and <span class=
        "application">KDE</span>.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part X - X Software
      </h2>
      <p>
        Office programs and graphical web browsers are important to most
        people. They, along with some generic <span class=
        "application">X</span> software can be found in this part of the
        book.
      </p>
      <h2>
