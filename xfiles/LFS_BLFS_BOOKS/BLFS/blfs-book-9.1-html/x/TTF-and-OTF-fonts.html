          About TTF and OTF fonts
        </h2>
        <p>
          Originally, Xorg provided only bitmap fonts. Later, some scalable
          Type1 fonts were added, but the desktop world moved on to using
          TrueType and Open Type fonts. To support these, Xorg uses Xft, the
          X FreeType interface library.
        </p>
        <p>
          These fonts can provide hints, which <span class=
          "application">fontconfig</span> uses to adjust them for maximum
          readability on computer monitors. On linux you should always prefer
          the hinted versions, if available (in general the latin, cyrillic
          and greek alphabets can use hints, most other writing systems do
          not use hinting).
        </p>
        <p>
          A few fonts are provided as collections (TTC or OTC) where font
          data is shared between different fonts, thus saving disk space.
          Treat these in exactly the same way as individual TTF or OTF files.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a font provides both TTF and OTF forms, prefer the OTF form in
          linux, it may provide more features for programs which know how to
          use them (such as xelatex).
        </p>
        <p>
          For some scripts <span class="application">pango</span> is required
          to render things correctly, either by selecting different glyph
          forms, or by combining glyphs - in both cases, according to the
          context. This applies particularly to arabic and indic scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standard scalable fonts that come with <span class=
          "application">X</span> provide very poor Unicode coverage. You may
          notice in applications that use <span class=
          "application">Xft</span> that some characters appear as a box with
          four binary digits inside. In this case, a font with the required
          glyphs has not been found. Other times, applications that don't use
          other font families by default and don't accept substitutions from
          <span class="application">Fontconfig</span> will display blank
          lines when the default font doesn't cover the orthography of the
          user's language.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fonts available to a program are those which were present when
          it was started, so if you add an extra font and wish to use it in a
          program which is currently running, then you will have to close and
          restart that program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people are happy to have dozens, or even hundreds, of font
          files available, but if you ever wish to select a specific font in
          a desktop application (for example in a word processor) then
          scrolling through a lot of fonts to find the right one is slow and
          awkward - fewer is better. So, for some font packages you might
          decide to install only one of the fonts - but nevertheless install
          the different variants (italic, bold, etc) as these are all
          variations for the same font name.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, everybody recommended running <span class=
          "command"><strong>fc-cache</strong></span> as the <code class=
          "systemitem">root</code> user after installing or removing fonts,
          but this is no-longer necessary on linux, <span class=
          "application">fontconfig</span> will do it automatically if needed
          and if its caches are more than 30 seconds old. But if you add a
          font and want to immediately use it then you can run that command
          (as a normal user).
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several references below to CJK characters. This stands
          for Chinese, Japanese and Korean, although modern Korean is now
          almost all written using the phonetic Hangul glyphs (it used to
          sometimes use Hanja glyphs which are similar to Chinese and
          Japanese). Unicode decided to go for <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification">Han Unification</a>
          and to map some Chinese and Japanese glyphs to the same codepoints.
          This was very unpopular in Japan, and the result is that different
          fonts will render some codepoints in quite different shapes. In
          addition, Simplified Chinese will sometimes use the same codepoint
          as Traditional Chinese but will show it differently, somewhat
          analogous to the different shapes used for the letters 'a' and 'g'
          in English (single-storey and two-storey), except that in a
          language context one will look "wrong" rather than just
          "different".
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike most other packages in this book, the BLFS editors do not
          monitor the versions of the fonts on this page - once a font is
          good enough for general use, the typical additions in a new version
          are minor (e.g. new currency symbols, or glyphs not for a modern
          language, such as emojis or playing cards). Therefore, none of
          these fonts show version or md5 information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list below will not provide complete Unicode coverage. Unicode
          is updated every year, and most additions are now for historic
          writing systems. For almost-complete coverage you can install
          <a class="xref" href="TTF-and-OTF-fonts.html#noto-fonts" title=
          "Noto fonts">Noto fonts</a> (about 180 fonts when last checked) but
          that number of fonts makes it <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>much</em></span> less convenient to select a
          specific font in a document, and most people will regard many of
          them as a waste of space. We used to recommend the <a class="ulink"
          href="http://unifont.org/fontguide/">Unicode Font Guide</a>, but
          that has not been updated since 2008 and many of its links are
          dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rendered examples of most of these fonts, and many others, with
          details of what languages they cover, some examples of latin fonts
          with the same metrics (listed as "Substitute latin fonts") and
          various files of dummy text to compare fonts of similar types, can
          be found at this <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://zarniwhoop.uk/ttf-otf-notes.html#examples">font
          comparison</a> page. That site also covers other current writing
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fonts are often supplied in zip files, requiring <a class="xref"
          href="../general/unzip.html" title="UnZip-6.0">UnZip-6.0</a> to
          list and extract them, but even if the current release is a tarball
          you should still check to see if it will create a directory
          (scatterring the contents of a zipfile or tarball across the
          current directory can be very messy, and a few fonts create odd
          __MACOSX/ directories. In addition, many fonts are supplied with
          permissions which do not let 'other' read them - if a font is to be
          installed for system-wide use, any directories must be mode 755 and
          all the files mode 644, so change them if necessary. If you forget,
          the root user may be able to see a particular font in <span class=
          "command"><strong>fc-list</strong></span> but a normal user will
          not.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a font installation example, consider the installation of the
          <a class="xref" href="TTF-and-OTF-fonts.html#dejavu-fonts" title=
          "DejaVu fonts">Dejavu fonts</a>. In this particular package, the
          TTF files are in a subdirectory. From the unpacked source
          directory, run the following commands as the <code class=
          "systemitem">root</code> user:
        </p>
        <pre class="root">
<kbd class="command">install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;
install -v -m644 ttf/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;
fc-cache -v /usr/share/fonts/dejavu</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          If you wish, you can also install any licenses or other
          documentation, either alongside the font or in a corresponding
          directory under <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few fonts ship with source as well as with the completed TTF or
          OTF file(s). Unless you intend to modify the font, and have the
          correct tools (sometimes <a class="xref" href=
          "../xsoft/fontforge.html" title=
          "FontForge-20170731">FontForge-20170731</a>, but often commercial
          tools), the source will provide no benefit, so do not install it.
          One or two fonts even ship with Web Open Font Format (WOFF) files -
          useful if you run a webserver and want to use that font on it, but
          not useful for desktops.
        </p>
        <p>
          To provide greater Unicode coverage, you are recommended to install
          some of the following fonts, depending on what webistes and
          languages you wish to read. The next part of this page details some
          fonts which cover at least latin alphabets, the final part deals
          with come CJK issues.

          (unlike DejaVu fonts which are comparatively large) and rather
          light weight ("less black" when black on white is used) which means
          that in some contexts such as terminals they are not visually
          pleasing, for example when most other glyphs are provided by
          another font. On the other hand, some fonts used primarily for
          printed output, and many CJK fonts, are also light weight.

          from 2002. They were supplied with old versions of Microsoft
          Windows and were apparently made available for general use. You can
          extract them from the 'exe' files using <span class=
          "application">bsd-tar</span> from <a class="xref" href=
          "../general/libarchive.html" title=

          (particularly Arial, Times New Roman, and to a lesser extent
          Courier New) were widely specified on web pages. The full set
          contains Andale Mono, Arial, Arial Black, Comic Sans MS, Courier

          Please note that if you only want to use a font with the same

          Roman you can use the libre Liberation Fonts (above), and similarly
          you can replace Georgia with Gelasio.

          Although many old posts recommend installing these fonts for
          better-looking output, there are more recent posts that these are
          ugly or 'broken'. One suggestion is that they do not support
          anti-aliasing.

          The newer fonts which Microsoft made their defaults in later

          fonts</a> ('No Tofu', i.e. avoiding boxes with dots [hex digits]

          <span class="emphasis"><em>every glyph in unicode, no matter how
          obscure</em></span>. These fonts, or at least the Sans Serif fonts,
          are used by KF5 (initially only for gtk applications). If you want

        <p>
          People using languages written in Latin, Greek or Cyrillic
          alphabets need only install Noto Sans itself, and perhaps Noto Sans
          Symbols for currency symbols. For more details on the CJK fonts see

        <p>
          However, you should be aware that <span class=

          'Noto Sans Something' fonts are each treated as separate fonts (and
          for Arabic there is not a specifically Sans name), so if you have
          other fonts installed then the choice of which font to use for
          missing glyphs where 'Noto Sans' is specified will be random,
          except that Sans fonts will be preferred over <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>known</em></span> Serif and Monospace fonts because
          Sans is the fallback for unknown fonts.

          Oxygen fonts</a> which were designed for integrated use with the
          KDE desktop. Those fonts are no-longer actively maintained, so KDE
          made a decision to switch to <a class="xref" href=

          files. But for a while the source has also included the prepared
          TTF. The only unusual feature is that each TTF file is in its own
          subdirectory (<code class="filename">oxygen-fonts/{*-?00}/</code>)
          with the source in further subdirectories. You could just install

        </h3>
        <p>
          As indicated earlier, usage of a combination of Chinese, Japanese
          and Korean can be tricky - each font only covers a subset of the
          available codepoints, the preferred shapes of the glyphs can differ
          between the languages, and many of the CJK fonts do not actually
          support modern Korean.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, by default <span class="application">fontconfig</span>
          prefers Chinese to Japanese. Tuning that is covered at <a class=
          "xref" href="tuning-fontconfig.html#prefer-chosen-CJK-fonts" title=
          "Prefer chosen CJK fonts">Prefer chosen CJK fonts</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Unicode has been extended to allow a very large number of
          CJK codepoints, those outside the Base Plane (greater than
          U+0xFFFF) are not commonly used in Mandarin (the normal form of
          written Chinese, whether Simplified (PRC) or Traditional (Taiwan)),
          or Japanese.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Hong Kong, which uses Traditional Chinese and where Cantonese
          is the dominant language, the Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set
          was added to Unicode in 2005 and revised in 2009 (it is part of CJK
          Extension B and contains more than 1900 characters). Earlier fonts
          will not be able to support either Cantonese or use of these
          characters where local names are written in Mandarin. The UMing HK,
          Noto Sans CJK HK and WenQuanYi Zen Hei fonts all seem to cover Hong
          Kong usage (<span class="application">fontconfig</span> disagrees
          about Noto Sans CJK HK).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Han glyphs are double-width, other glyphs in the same font may
          be narrower. For their CJK content, all of these fonts can be
          regarded as monospaced (i.e. fixed width).
        </p>
        <p>
          If all you wish to do is to be able to render CJK glyphs,

          In Chinese, there are three font styles in common use: Sung (also
          known as Song or Ming) which is the most-common ornamented
          ("serif") form, Kai ("brush strokes") which is an earlier
          ornamented style that looks quite different, and modern Hei
          ("sans"). Unless you appreciate the differences, you probably do
          not want to install Kai fonts.
