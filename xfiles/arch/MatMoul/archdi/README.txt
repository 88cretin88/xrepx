# archdi

Just a simple bash script wizard to install and configure a full personal computer with Arch Linux.

First, install Arch Linux with the official media and optionally with archfi.
Look at archfi project to start your arch linux installation : https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi

After reboot and your network ready, download the script :
curl -L archdi.sf.net/archdi > archdi
or if sourceforge is down :
curl -L matmoul.github.io/archdi > archdi

And run the script :
sh archdi

Or you can install it on your system with
sh archdi -i
And then you can use archdi cmd.
With this, you can make your updates or install your packages later.

You can watch my videos to show how to use it :
