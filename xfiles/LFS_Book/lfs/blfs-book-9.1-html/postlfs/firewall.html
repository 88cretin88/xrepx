        Before you read this part of the chapter, you should have already
        installed iptables as described in the previous section.

          Creation
        </h2>
        <p>
          The general purpose of a firewall is to protect a computer or a
          network against malicious access.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a perfect world, every daemon or service on every machine is
          perfectly configured and immune to flaws such as buffer overflows
          or other problems regarding its security. Furthermore, you trust
          every user accessing your services. In this world, you do not need
          to have a firewall.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the real world however, daemons may be misconfigured and
          exploits against essential services are freely available. You may
          wish to choose which services are accessible by certain machines or
          you may wish to limit which machines or applications are allowed
          external access. Alternatively, you may simply not trust some of
          your applications or users. You are probably connected to the
          Internet. In this world, a firewall is essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't assume however, that having a firewall makes careful
          configuration redundant, or that it makes any negligent
          misconfiguration harmless. It doesn't prevent anyone from
          exploiting a service you intentionally offer but haven't recently
          updated or patched after an exploit went public. Despite having a
          firewall, you need to keep applications and daemons on your system
          properly configured and up to date. A firewall is not a cure all,
          but should be an essential part of your overall security strategy.

          Meaning of the Word "Firewall"

        <p>
          The word firewall can have several different meanings.

            This is a hardware device or software program commercially sold
            (or offered via freeware) by companies such as Symantec which
            claims that it secures a home or desktop computer connected to
            the Internet. This type of firewall is highly relevant for users
            who do not know how their computers might be accessed via the
            Internet or how to disable that access, especially if they are
            always online and connected via broadband links.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is a system placed between the Internet and an intranet. To
            minimize the risk of compromising the firewall itself, it should
            generally have only one role&mdash;that of protecting the
            intranet. Although not completely risk free, the tasks of doing
            the routing and IP masquerading (rewriting IP headers of the
            packets it routes from clients with private IP addresses onto the
            Internet so that they seem to come from the firewall itself) are
            commonly considered relatively secure.

            This is often an old computer you may have retired and nearly
            forgotten, performing masquerading or routing functions, but
            offering non-firewall services such as a web-cache or mail. This
            may be used for home networks, but is not to be considered as
            secure as a firewall only machine because the combination of
            server and router/firewall on one machine raises the complexity
            of the setup.

            This box performs masquerading or routing, but grants public
            access to some branch of your network which, because of public
            IPs and a physically separated structure, is essentially a
            separate network with direct Internet access. The servers on this
            network are those which must be easily accessible from both the
            Internet and intranet. The firewall protects both networks. This
            type of firewall has a minimum of three network interfaces.

            This type of firewall does routing or masquerading, but does not
            maintain a state table of ongoing communication streams. It is
            fast, but quite limited in its ability to block undesired packets
            without blocking desired packets.

            Caution
          </h3>
          <p>
            This introduction on how to setup a firewall is not a complete
            guide to securing systems. Firewalling is a complex issue that
            requires careful configuration. The scripts quoted here are
            simply intended to give examples of how a firewall works. They
            are not intended to fit into any particular configuration and may
            not provide complete protection from an attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customization of these scripts for your specific situation will
            be necessary for an optimal configuration, but you should make a
            serious study of the iptables documentation and creating
            firewalls in general before hacking away. Have a look at the list
            of <a class="xref" href="firewall.html#fw-library" title=
            "Where to Start with Further Reading on Firewalls">links for
            further reading</a> at the end of this section for more details.
            There you will find a list of URLs that contain quite
            comprehensive information about building your own firewall.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The firewall configuration script installed in the iptables section
          differs from the standard configuration script. It only has two of
          the standard targets: start and status. The other targets are clear
          and lock. For instance if you issue:
        </p>
        <pre class="root">
<kbd class="command">/etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables start</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          the firewall will be restarted just as it is upon system startup.
          The status target will present a list of all currently implemented
          rules. The clear target turns off all firewall rules and the lock
          target will block all packets in and out of the computer with the
          exception of the loopback interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main startup firewall is located in the file <code class=
          "filename">/etc/rc.d/rc.iptables</code>. The sections below provide
          three different approaches that can be used for a system.

            Note

          <p>
            You should always run your firewall rules from a script. This
            ensures consistency and a record of what was done. It also allows
            retention of comments that are essential for understanding the
            rules long after they were written.

            A Personal Firewall is designed to let you access all the
            services offered on the Internet, but keep your box secure and
            your data private.

            daemon on your system crash, or even worse, that implements a
            worm via a buffer-overflow).

            firewall should be relatively safe because there are no services
            running that a cracker could attack.

              Outlining a true concept of how to protect a server that offers
              services on the Internet goes far beyond the scope of this
              document. See the references at the end of this section for
              more information.

          </div>
          <p>
            Be cautious. Every service you have enabled makes your setup more
            complex and your firewall less secure. You are exposed to the
            risks of misconfigured services or running a service with an
            exploitable bug. A firewall should generally not run any extra
            services. See the introduction to the <a class="xref" href=
            "firewall.html#fw-masqRouter" title=
            "Masquerading Router">Masquerading Router</a> for some more
            details.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to add services such as internal Samba or name
            servers that do not need to access the Internet themselves, the
            additional statements are quite simple and should still be
            acceptable from a security standpoint. Just add the following
            lines into the script <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the logging rules.
          </p>
          <pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">iptables -A INPUT  -i ! ppp+  -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o ! ppp+  -j ACCEPT</code>
</pre>
          <p>
            If daemons, such as squid, have to access the Internet
            themselves, you could open OUTPUT generally and restrict INPUT.
          </p>
          <pre class="screen">
<code class=
"literal">iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT</code>
</pre>
          <p>
            However, it is generally not advisable to leave OUTPUT
            unrestricted. You lose any control over trojans who would like to
            "call home", and a bit of redundancy in case you've
            (mis-)configured a service so that it broadcasts its existence to
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            To accomplish this, you should restrict INPUT and OUTPUT on all
            ports except those that it's absolutely necessary to have open.
            Which ports you have to open depends on your needs: mostly you
            will find them by looking for failed accesses in your log files.

            iptables. There you will find much more information. The port
            numbers needed for this can be found in <code class=
            "filename">/etc/services</code>, in case you didn't find them by
            trial and error in your log file.

          Finally, there is one fact you must not forget: The effort spent
          attacking a system corresponds to the value the cracker expects to
          gain from it. If you are responsible for valuable information, you
          need to spend the time to protect it properly.
