          Decent Rescue Boot Device Needs
        </h2>
        <p>
          This section is really about creating a <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>rescue</em></span> device. As the name <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>rescue</em></span> implies, the host system has a
          problem, often lost partition information or corrupted file
          systems, that prevents it from booting and/or operating normally.
          For this reason, you <span class="emphasis"><em>must
          not</em></span> depend on resources from the host being "rescued".
          To presume that any given partition or hard drive <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>will</em></span> be available is a risky
          presumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a modern system, there are many devices that can be used as a
          rescue device: floppy, cdrom, usb drive, or even a network card.
          Which one you use depends on your hardware and your BIOS. In the
          past, a rescue device was thought to be a floppy disk. Today, many
          systems do not even have a floppy drive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building a complete rescue device is a challenging task. In many
          ways, it is equivalent to building an entire LFS system. In
          addition, it would be a repetition of information already
          available. For these reasons, the procedures for a rescue device
          image are not presented here.

          Creating a Rescue Floppy
        </h2>
        <p>
          The software of today's systems has grown large. Linux 2.6 no
          longer supports booting directly from a floppy. In spite of this,
          there are solutions available using older versions of Linux. One of
          the best is Tom's Root/Boot Disk available at <a class="ulink"
          href="http://www.toms.net/rb/">http://www.toms.net/rb/</a>. This
          will provide a minimal Linux system on a single floppy disk and
          provides the ability to customize the contents of your disk if
          necessary.

          Creating a Bootable CD-ROM
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are several sources that can be used for a rescue CD-ROM.
          Just about any commercial distribution's installation CD-ROMs or
          DVDs will work. These include RedHat, Ubuntu, and SuSE. One very
          popular option is Knoppix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the LFS Community has developed its own LiveCD available at
          <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/livecd/">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/livecd/</a>.
          This LiveCD, is no longer capable of building an entire LFS/BLFS
          system, but is still a good rescue CD-ROM. If you download the ISO
          image, use <a class="xref" href=
          "../multimedia/libisoburn.html#xorriso"><span class=
          "command"><strong>xorriso</strong></span></a> to copy the image to
          a CD-ROM.
        </p>
        <p>
          The instructions for using GRUB2 to make a custom rescue CD-ROM are
          also available in <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter08/grub.html">

          Creating a Bootable USB Drive
        </h2>
        <p>
          A USB Pen drive, sometimes called a Thumb drive, is recognized by
          Linux as a SCSI device. Using one of these devices as a rescue
          device has the advantage that it is usually large enough to hold
          more than a minimal boot image. You can save critical data to the
          drive as well as use it to diagnose and recover a damaged system.
          Booting such a drive requires BIOS support, but building the system
          consists of formatting the drive, adding <span class=
          "application">GRUB</span> as well as the Linux kernel and
          supporting files.
