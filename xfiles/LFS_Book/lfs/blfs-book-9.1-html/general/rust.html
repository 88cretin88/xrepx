          Introduction to Rust
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <span class="application">Rust</span> programming language is
          designed to be a safe, concurrent, practical language.
        </p>
        <p>
          This package is updated on a six-weekly release cycle. Because it
          is such a large and slow package to build, and is at the moment
          only required by a few packages in this book, the BLFS editors take
          the view that it should only be updated when that is necessary
          (either to fix problems, or to allow a new version of <span class=
          "application">firefox</span> to build).
        </p>
        <p>
          As with many other programming languages, rustc (the rust compiler)
          needs a binary from which to bootstrap. It will download a stage0
          binary and many cargo crates (these are actually .tar.gz source
          archives) at the start of the build, so you cannot compile it
          without an internet connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          These crates will then remain in various forms (cache, directories
          of extracted source), in <code class="filename">~/.cargo</code> for
          ever more. It is common for large <span class=
          "application">rust</span> packages to use multiple versions of some
          crates. If you purge the files before updating this package, very
          few crates will need to be updated by the packages in this book
          which use it (and they will be downloaded as required). But if you
          retain an older version as a fallback option and then use it (when
          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> building in <code class=
          "filename">/usr</code>), it is likely that it will then have to
          re-download some crates. For a full download (i.e. starting with an
          empty or missing <code class="filename">~/.cargo</code>)
          downloading the external cargo files for this version only takes a
          minute or so on a fast network.
        </p>
        <div class="admon note">
          <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />
          <h3>
            Note
          </h3>
          <p>
            Although BLFS usually installs in <code class=
            "filename">/usr</code>, when you later upgrade to a newer version
            of <span class="application">rust</span> the old libraries in
            <code class="filename">/usr/lib/rustlib</code> will remain, with
            various hashes in their names, but will not be usable and will
            waste space. The editors recommend placing the files in the
            <code class="filename">/opt</code> directory. In particular, if
            you have reason to rebuild with a modified configuration (e.g.
            using the shipped LLVM after building with shared LLVM, but
            perhaps also the reverse situation) it it possible for the
            install to leave a broken <span class=
            "command"><strong>cargo</strong></span> program. In such a
            situation, either remove the existing installation first, or use
            a different prefix such as /opt/rustc-1.37.0-build2.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you prefer, you can of course change the prefix to
            <code class="filename">/usr</code> and omit the <span class=
            "command"><strong>ldconfig</strong></span> and the actions to add
            rustc to the PATH.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The current <span class="application">rustbuild</span> build-system
          will use all available processors, although it does not scale well
          and often falls back to just using one core while waiting for a
          library to compile.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment <span class="application">Rust</span> does not
          provide any guarantees of a stable ABI.
        </p>
        <div class="admon note">
          <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />
          <h3>
            Note
          </h3>
          <p>
            Rustc defaults to building for ALL supported architectures, using
            a shipped copy of LLVM. In BLFS the build is only for the X86
            architecture. Rustc still claims to require Python 2, but that is
            only really necessary when building some other architectures with
            the shipped LLVM. If you intend to develop rust crates, this
            build may not be good enough for your purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The build times of this version when repeated on the same machine
            are often reasonably consistent, but as with all compilations
            using <span class="command"><strong>rustc</strong></span> there
            can be some very slow outliers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unusually, a DESTDIR-style method is being used to install this
            package. This is because running the install as root not only
            downloads all of the cargo files again (to <code class=
            "filename">/root/.cargo</code>), it then spends a very long time
            recompiling. Using this method saves a lot of time, at the cost
            of extra disk space.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.1
          platform.

            The testsuite will generate some messages in the <span class=
            "phrase">system log</span> for traps on invalid opcodes, and for
            segmentation faults. In themselves these are nothing to worry
            about, just a way for the test to be terminated.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          To run the tests issue <span class="command"><strong>python3 ./x.py
          test --verbose --no-fail-fast | tee rustc-testlog</strong></span>:
          as with the build, that will use all available CPUs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The instructions above do not build ARM compilers, so the testsuite
          <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> fail and the tests will
          be reported to end in error, with a backtrace of the last failing
          test. On a good run, 3 tests which need Thumb (ARM) compilers will
          fail, all in <code class="filename">ui/issues</code> for issues
          37131, 49851 and 50993. A fourth test, <code class=
          "filename">run-make-fulldeps/sysroot-crates-are-unstable</code>
          fails, presumably because we are using only stable features. As
          with all large testsuites, other tests might fail on some machines
          - if the number of failures is in the single digits, check the log
          for 'FAILED' and review lines above that, particularly the
          'stderr:' lines. Any mention of SIGSEGV or signal 11 in a failing
          test is a cause for concern. A fifth test,
          run-make-fulldeps/linker-output-non-utf8, is known to fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, you should determine the number of tests, failures, etc.
          The total number of tests which were considered is found by
          running:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class=
"command">grep 'running .* tests' rustc-testlog | awk '{ sum += $2 } END { print sum }'</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          That should report 16499 tests. Similarly, the total tests which
          failed can be found by running:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class=
"command">grep '^test result:' rustc-testlog | awk  '{ sum += $6 } END { print sum }'</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          And similarly for the tests which passed use $4, for those which
          were ignored (i.e. skipped) use $8 (and $10 for 'measured', $12 for
          'filtered out' but both are probably zero). The breakdown does not
          quite match the overall total.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still as your normal user, do a DESTDIR install:

          <code class="filename">config.toml</code> is to use development
          features, which is not appropriate for a released version.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>rpath = false</strong></span>: by
          default, <span class="command"><strong>rust</strong></span> can be
          run from where it was built, without being installed. That adds
          DT_RPATH entries to all of the ELF files, which produces very messy
          output from <span class="command"><strong>ldd</strong></span>,
          showing the libraries in the place they were built, even if they
          have been deleted from there after the install.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>export RUSTFLAGS="$RUSTFLAGS -C
          link-args=-lffi"</strong></span>: This adds a link to libffi to any
          RUSTFLAGS you may already be passing to the build. On some systems,
          linking fails to include libffi unless this is used. The reason why
          this is needed is not clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>--exclude
          src/tools/miri</strong></span>: For a long time, the miri crate (an
          interpreter for the Midlevel Intermediate Representation) has
          failed to build on releases. It is optional, but the failure
          messages can persuade people that the whole build failed. However,
          although it is not built in the main compile, with rustc-1.35.0 it
          now gets compiled during the install, but it is broken in this
          version.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>--verbose</strong></span>: this
          switch can sometimes provide more information about a test which
          fails.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>--no-fail-fast</strong></span>: this
          switch ensures that the testsuite will not stop at the first error.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>export
          LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG=1</strong></span>: On some systems,
          cairo fails to link during the install because it cannot find
          libssh2. This seems to fix it, but again the reason why the problem
          occurs is not understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>DESTDIR=${PWD}/install python3 ./x.py
          install</strong></span>: This effects a DESTDIR-style install in
          the source tree,creating an <code class="filename">install</code>
          directory. Note that DESTDIR installs need an absolute path,
          passing 'install' will not work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>chown -R root:root
          install</strong></span>: the DESTDIR install was run by a regular
          user, who owns the files. For security, change their owner before
          doing a simple copy to install them.
