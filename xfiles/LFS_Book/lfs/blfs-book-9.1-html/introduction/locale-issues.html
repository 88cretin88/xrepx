          Option in the Program
        </h2>
        <p>
          Severity: Critical
        </p>
        <p>
          Some programs require the user to specify the character encoding
          for their input or output data and present only a limited choice of
          encodings. This is the case for the <code class="option">-X</code>
          option in <a class="xref" href="../pst/a2ps.html" title=
          "a2ps-4.14">a2ps-4.14</a> and <a class="xref" href=
          "../pst/enscript.html" title="Enscript-1.6.6">Enscript-1.6.6</a>,
          the <code class="option">-input-charset</code> option in unpatched
          <a class="xref" href="../multimedia/cdrtools.html" title=
          "Cdrtools-3.02a09">Cdrtools-3.02a09</a>, and the character sets
          offered for display in the menu of <a class="xref" href=
          "../basicnet/links.html" title="Links-2.20.2">Links-2.20.2</a>. If
          the required encoding is not in the list, the program usually
          becomes completely unusable. For non-interactive programs, it may
          be possible to work around this by converting the document to a
          supported input character set before submitting to the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          A solution to this type of problem is to implement the necessary
          support for the missing encoding as a patch to the original program
          or to find a replacement.

          "locale-assumed-encoding"></a>The Program Assumes the Locale-Based
          Encoding of External Documents
        </h2>
        <p>
          Severity: High for non-text documents, low for text documents
        </p>
        <p>
          Some programs, <a class="xref" href="../postlfs/nano.html" title=
          "Nano-4.8">nano-4.8</a> or <a class="xref" href=
          "../postlfs/joe.html" title="JOE-4.6">JOE-4.6</a> for example,
          assume that documents are always in the encoding implied by the
          current locale. While this assumption may be valid for the
          user-created documents, it is not safe for external ones. When this
          assumption fails, non-ASCII characters are displayed incorrectly,
          and the document may become unreadable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the external document is entirely text based, it can be
          converted to the current locale encoding using the <span class=
          "command"><strong>iconv</strong></span> program.
        </p>
        <p>
          For documents that are not text-based, this is not possible. In
          fact, the assumption made in the program may be completely invalid
          for documents where the Microsoft Windows operating system has set
          de facto standards. An example of this problem is ID3v1 tags in MP3
          files (see the <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/ID3v1Coding">BLFS Wiki
          ID3v1Coding page</a> for more details). For these cases, the only
          solution is to find a replacement program that doesn't have the
          issue (e.g., one that will allow you to specify the assumed
          document encoding).
        </p>
        <p>
          Among BLFS packages, this problem applies to <a class="xref" href=
          "../postlfs/nano.html" title="Nano-4.8">nano-4.8</a>, <a class=
          "xref" href="../postlfs/joe.html" title="JOE-4.6">JOE-4.6</a>, and
          all media players except <a class="xref" href=
          "../multimedia/audacious.html" title=
          "Audacious-3.10.1">Audacious-3.10.1</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another problem in this category is when someone cannot read the
          documents you've sent them because their operating system is set up
          to handle character encodings differently. This can happen often
          when the other person is using Microsoft Windows, which only
          provides one character encoding for a given country. For example,
          this causes problems with UTF-8 encoded TeX documents created in
          Linux. On Windows, most applications will assume that these
          documents have been created using the default Windows 8-bit
          encoding.
        </p>
        <p>
          In extreme cases, Windows encoding compatibility issues may be
          solved only by running Windows programs under <a class="ulink"
          href="http://www.winehq.com/">Wine</a>.

          <a id="locale-wrong-filename-encoding" name=
          "locale-wrong-filename-encoding"></a>The Program Uses or Creates
          Filenames in the Wrong Encoding
        </h2>
        <p>
          Severity: Critical
        </p>
        <p>
          The POSIX standard mandates that the filename encoding is the
          encoding implied by the current LC_CTYPE locale category. This
          information is well-hidden on the page which specifies the behavior
          of <span class="application">Tar</span> and <span class=
          "application">Cpio</span> programs. Some programs get it wrong by
          default (or simply don't have enough information to get it right).
          The result is that they create filenames which are not subsequently
          shown correctly by <span class=
          "command"><strong>ls</strong></span>, or they refuse to accept
          filenames that <span class="command"><strong>ls</strong></span>
          shows properly. For the <a class="xref" href=
          "../general/glib2.html" title="GLib-2.62.4">GLib-2.62.4</a>
          library, the problem can be corrected by setting the <code class=
          "envar">G_FILENAME_ENCODING</code> environment variable to the
          special "@locale" value. <span class="application">Glib2</span>
          based programs that don't respect that environment variable are
          buggy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a class="xref" href="../general/zip.html" title=
          "Zip-3.0">Zip-3.0</a> and <a class="xref" href=
          "../general/unzip.html" title="UnZip-6.0">UnZip-6.0</a> have this
          problem because they hard-code the expected filename encoding.
          <span class="application">UnZip</span> contains a hard-coded
          conversion table between the CP850 (DOS) and ISO-8859-1 (UNIX)
          encodings and uses this table when extracting archives created
          under DOS or Microsoft Windows. However, this assumption only works
          for those in the US and not for anyone using a UTF-8 locale.
          Non-ASCII characters will be mangled in the extracted filenames.
        </p>
        <p>
          The general rule for avoiding this class of problems is to avoid
          installing broken programs. If this is impossible, the <a class=
          "ulink" href="http://j3e.de/linux/convmv/">convmv</a> command-line
          tool can be used to fix filenames created by these broken programs,
          or intentionally mangle the existing filenames to meet the broken
          expectations of such programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other cases, a similar problem is caused by importing filenames
          from a system using a different locale with a tool that is not
          locale-aware (e.g., <a class="xref" href="../postlfs/openssh.html"
          title="OpenSSH-8.2p1">OpenSSH-8.2p1</a>). In order to avoid
          mangling non-ASCII characters when transferring files to a system
          with a different locale, any of the following methods can be used:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>
                Transfer anyway, fix the damage with <span class=
                "command"><strong>convmv</strong></span>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>
                On the sending side, create a tar archive with the <em class=
                "parameter"><code>--format=posix</code></em> switch passed to
                <span class="command"><strong>tar</strong></span> (this will
                be the default in a future version of <span class=
                "command"><strong>tar</strong></span>).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>
                Mail the files as attachments. Mail clients specify the
                encoding of attached filenames.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>
                Write the files to a removable disk formatted with a FAT or
                FAT32 filesystem.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>
                Transfer the files using Samba.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>
                Transfer the files via FTP using RFC2640-aware server (this
                currently means only wu-ftpd, which has bad security history)
                and client (e.g., lftp).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          The last four methods work because the filenames are automatically
          converted from the sender's locale to UNICODE and stored or sent in
          this form. They are then transparently converted from UNICODE to
          the recipient's locale encoding.

          Multibyte Characters or Doesn't Count Character Cells Correctly
        </h2>
        <p>
          Severity: High or critical
        </p>
        <p>
          Many programs were written in an older era where multibyte locales
          were not common. Such programs assume that C "char" data type,
          which is one byte, can be used to store single characters. Further,
          they assume that any sequence of characters is a valid string and
          that every character occupies a single character cell. Such
          assumptions completely break in UTF-8 locales. The visible
          manifestation is that the program truncates strings prematurely
          (i.e., at 80 bytes instead of 80 characters). Terminal-based
          programs don't place the cursor correctly on the screen, don't
          react to the "Backspace" key by erasing one character, and leave
          junk characters around when updating the screen, usually turning
          the screen into a complete mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fixing this kind of problems is a tedious task from a programmer's
          point of view, like all other cases of retrofitting new concepts
          into the old flawed design. In this case, one has to redesign all
          data structures in order to accommodate to the fact that a complete
          character may span a variable number of "char"s (or switch to
          wchar_t and convert as needed). Also, for every call to the
          "strlen" and similar functions, find out whether a number of bytes,
          a number of characters, or the width of the string was really
          meant. Sometimes it is faster to write a program with the same
          functionality from scratch.

        <p>
          LFS expects that manual pages are in the language-specific (usually
          8-bit) encoding, as specified on the <a class="ulink" href=
          "../../../../lfs/view/9.1/chapter06/man-db.html">LFS Man DB
          page</a>. However, some packages install translated manual pages in
          UTF-8 encoding (e.g., Shadow, already dealt with), or manual pages
          in languages not in the table. Not all BLFS packages have been
          audited for conformance with the requirements put in LFS (the large
          majority have been checked, and fixes placed in the book for
          packages known to install non-conforming manual pages). If you find
          a manual page installed by any of BLFS packages that is obviously
          in the wrong encoding, please remove or convert it as needed, and
          report this to BLFS team as a bug.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can easily check your system for any non-conforming manual
          pages by copying the following short shell script to some
          accessible location,
        </p>
        <pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">#!/bin/sh
# Begin checkman.sh
# Usage: find /usr/share/man -type f | xargs checkman.sh
for a in "$@"
do
    # echo "Checking $a..."
    # Pure-ASCII manual page (possibly except comments) is OK
    grep -v '.\\"' "$a" | iconv -f US-ASCII -t US-ASCII &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 \
        &amp;&amp; continue
    # Non-UTF-8 manual page is OK
    iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8 "$a" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || continue
    # Found a UTF-8 manual page, bad.
    echo "UTF-8 manual page: $a" &gt;&amp;2
done
# End checkman.sh
</code>
</pre>
        <p>
          and then issuing the following command (modify the command below if
          the <span class="command"><strong>checkman.sh</strong></span>
          script is not in your <code class="envar">PATH</code> environment
          variable):
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">

</pre>
        <p>
          Note that if you have manual pages installed in any location other
          than <code class="filename">/usr/share/man</code> (e.g.,
          <code class="filename">/usr/local/share/man</code>), you must
          modify the above command to include this additional location.
