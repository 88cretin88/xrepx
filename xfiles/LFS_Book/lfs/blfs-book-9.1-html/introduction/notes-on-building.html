        <a id="unpacking" name="unpacking"></a>Notes on Building Software
      </h1>
      <p>
        Those people who have built an LFS system may be aware of the general
        principles of downloading and unpacking software. Some of that
        information is repeated here for those new to building their own
        software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each set of installation instructions contains a URL from which you
        can download the package. The patches; however, are stored on the LFS
        servers and are available via HTTP. These are referenced as needed in
        the installation instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you can keep the source files anywhere you like, we assume that
        you have unpacked the package and changed into the directory created
        by the unpacking process (the 'build' directory). We also assume you
        have uncompressed any required patches and they are in the directory
        immediately above the 'build' directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can not emphasize strongly enough that you should start from a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>clean source tree</em></span> each time.
        This means that if you have had an error during configuration or
        compilation, it's usually best to delete the source tree and
        re-unpack it <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> trying
        again. This obviously doesn't apply if you're an advanced user used
        to hacking <code class="filename">Makefile</code>s and C code, but if
        in doubt, start from a clean tree.
      </p>

          Building Software as an Unprivileged (non-root) User
        </h2>
        <p>
          The golden rule of Unix System Administration is to use your
          superpowers only when necessary. Hence, BLFS recommends that you
          build software as an unprivileged user and only become the
          <code class="systemitem">root</code> user when installing the
          software. This philosophy is followed in all the packages in this
          book. Unless otherwise specified, all instructions should be
          executed as an unprivileged user. The book will advise you on
          instructions that need <code class="systemitem">root</code>
          privileges.

          Unpacking the Software
        </h2>
        <p>
          If a file is in <code class="filename">.tar</code> format and
          compressed, it is unpacked by running one of the following
          commands:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">tar -xvf filename.tar.gz
tar -xvf filename.tgz
tar -xvf filename.tar.Z
tar -xvf filename.tar.bz2</kbd>
</pre>
        <div class="admon note">
          <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />
          <h3>
            Note
          </h3>
          <p>
            You may omit using the <code class="option">v</code> parameter in
            the commands shown above and below if you wish to suppress the
            verbose listing of all the files in the archive as they are
            extracted. This can help speed up the extraction as well as make
            any errors produced during the extraction more obvious to you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          You can also use a slightly different method:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">bzcat filename.tar.bz2 | tar -xv</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Finally, you sometimes need to be able to unpack patches which are
          generally not in <code class="filename">.tar</code> format. The
          best way to do this is to copy the patch file to the parent of the
          'build' directory and then run one of the following commands
          depending on whether the file is a <code class=
          "filename">.gz</code> or <code class="filename">.bz2</code> file:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">gunzip -v patchname.gz
bunzip2 -v patchname.bz2</kbd>

          Verifying File Integrity Using 'md5sum'
        </h2>
        <p>
          Generally, to verify that the downloaded file is genuine and
          complete, many package maintainers also distribute md5sums of the
          files. To verify the md5sum of the downloaded files, download both
          the file and the corresponding md5sum file to the same directory
          (preferably from different on-line locations), and (assuming
          <code class="filename">file.md5sum</code> is the md5sum file
          downloaded) run the following command:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">md5sum -c file.md5sum</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          If there are any errors, they will be reported. Note that the BLFS
          book includes md5sums for all the source files also. To use the
          BLFS supplied md5sums, you can create a <code class=
          "filename">file.md5sum</code> (place the md5sum data and the exact
          name of the downloaded file on the same line of a file, separated
          by white space) and run the command shown above. Alternately,
          simply run the command shown below and compare the output to the
          md5sum data shown in the BLFS book.

          Creating Log Files During Installation
        </h2>
        <p>
          For larger packages, it is convenient to create log files instead
          of staring at the screen hoping to catch a particular error or
          warning. Log files are also useful for debugging and keeping
          records. The following command allows you to create an installation
          log. Replace <em class=
          "replaceable"><code>&lt;command&gt;</code></em> with the command
          you intend to execute.
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">( <em class=
"replaceable"><code>&lt;command&gt;</code></em> 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee compile.log &amp;&amp; exit $PIPESTATUS )</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          <code class="option">2&gt;&amp;1</code> redirects error messages to
          the same location as standard output. The <span class=
          "command"><strong>tee</strong></span> command allows viewing of the
          output while logging the results to a file. The parentheses around
          the command run the entire command in a subshell and finally the
          <span class="command"><strong>exit $PIPESTATUS</strong></span>
          command ensures the result of the <em class=
          "replaceable"><code>&lt;command&gt;</code></em> is returned as the
          result and not the result of the <span class=
          "command"><strong>tee</strong></span> command.

          <a id="parallel-builds" name="parallel-builds"></a>Using Multiple
          Processors
        </h2>
        <p>
          For many modern systems with multiple processors (or cores) the
          compilation time for a package can be reduced by performing a
          "parallel make" by either setting an environment variable or
          telling the make program how many processors are available. For
          instance, a Core2Duo can support two simultaneous processes with:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">export MAKEFLAGS='-j2'</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          or just building with:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">make -j2</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Generally the number of processes should not exceed the number of
          cores supported by the CPU. To list the processors on your system,
          issue: <strong class="userinput"><code>grep processor
          /proc/cpuinfo</code></strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, using multiple processors may result in a 'race'
          condition where the success of the build depends on the order of
          the commands run by the <span class=
          "command"><strong>make</strong></span> program. For instance, if an
          executable needs File A and File B, attempting to link the program
          before one of the dependent components is available will result in
          a failure. This condition usually arises because the upstream
          developer has not properly designated all the prerequisites needed
          to accomplish a step in the Makefile.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this occurs, the best way to proceed is to drop back to a single
          processor build. Adding '-j1' to a make command will override the
          similar setting in the MAKEFLAGS environment variable.

            Note
          </h3>
          <p>
            When running the package tests or the install portion of the
            package build process, we do not recommend using an option
            greater than '-j1' unless specified otherwise. The installation
            procedures or checks have not been validated using parallel
            procedures and may fail with issues that are difficult to debug.

          Building Procedures
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are times when automating the building of a package can come
          in handy. Everyone has their own reasons for wanting to automate
          building, and everyone goes about it in their own way. Creating
          <code class="filename">Makefile</code>s, <span class=
          "application">Bash</span> scripts, <span class=
          "application">Perl</span> scripts or simply a list of commands used
          to cut and paste are just some of the methods you can use to
          automate building BLFS packages. Detailing how and providing
          examples of the many ways you can automate the building of packages
          is beyond the scope of this section. This section will expose you
          to using file redirection and the <span class=
          "command"><strong>yes</strong></span> command to help provide ideas
          on how to automate your builds.
        </p>
        <h3>
          File Redirection to Automate Input
        </h3>
        <p>
          You will find times throughout your BLFS journey when you will come
          across a package that has a command prompting you for information.
          This information might be configuration details, a directory path,
          or a response to a license agreement. This can present a challenge
          to automate the building of that package. Occasionally, you will be
          prompted for different information in a series of questions. One
          method to automate this type of scenario requires putting the
          desired responses in a file and using redirection so that the
          program uses the data in the file as the answers to the questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building the <span class="application">CUPS</span> package is a
          good example of how redirecting a file as input to prompts can help
          you automate the build. If you run the test suite, you are asked to
          respond to a series of questions regarding the type of test to run
          and if you have any auxiliary programs the test can use. You can
          create a file with your responses, one response per line, and use a
          command similar to the one shown below to automate running the test
          suite:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">make check &lt; ../cups-1.1.23-testsuite_parms</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          This effectively makes the test suite use the responses in the file
          as the input to the questions. Occasionally you may end up doing a
          bit of trial and error determining the exact format of your input
          file for some things, but once figured out and documented you can
          use this to automate building the package.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Using <span class="command"><strong>yes</strong></span> to Automate
          Input
        </h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes you will only need to provide one response, or provide
          the same response to many prompts. For these instances, the
          <span class="command"><strong>yes</strong></span> command works
          really well. The <span class="command"><strong>yes</strong></span>
          command can be used to provide a response (the same one) to one or
          more instances of questions. It can be used to simulate pressing
          just the <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key,
          entering the <span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span> key or
          entering a string of text. Perhaps the easiest way to show its use
          is in an example.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, create a short <span class="application">Bash</span> script
          by entering the following commands:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">cat &gt; blfs-yes-test1 &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<code class="literal">#!/bin/bash

echo -n -e "\n\nPlease type something (or nothing) and press Enter ---&gt; "

read A_STRING

if test "$A_STRING" = ""; then A_STRING="Just the Enter key was pressed"
else A_STRING="You entered '$A_STRING'"
fi

echo -e "\n\n$A_STRING\n\n"</code>
EOF
chmod 755 blfs-yes-test1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Now run the script by issuing <span class=
          "command"><strong>./blfs-yes-test1</strong></span> from the command
          line. It will wait for a response, which can be anything (or
          nothing) followed by the <span class=
          "keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key. After entering
          something, the result will be echoed to the screen. Now use the
          <span class="command"><strong>yes</strong></span> command to
          automate the entering of a response:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">yes | ./blfs-yes-test1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Notice that piping <span class=
          "command"><strong>yes</strong></span> by itself to the script
          results in <span class="keycap"><strong>y</strong></span> being
          passed to the script. Now try it with a string of text:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">yes 'This is some text' | ./blfs-yes-test1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          The exact string was used as the response to the script. Finally,
          try it using an empty (null) string:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">yes '' | ./blfs-yes-test1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Notice this results in passing just the press of the <span class=
          "keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key to the script. This is
          useful for times when the default answer to the prompt is
          sufficient. This syntax is used in the <a class="xref" href=
          "../basicnet/net-tools.html#net-tools-automate-example">Net-tools</a>
          instructions to accept all the defaults to the many prompts during
          the configuration step. You may now remove the test script, if
          desired.
        </p>
        <h3>
          File Redirection to Automate Output
        </h3>
        <p>
          In order to automate the building of some packages, especially
          those that require you to read a license agreement one page at a
          time, requires using a method that avoids having to press a key to
          display each page. Redirecting the output to a file can be used in
          these instances to assist with the automation. The previous section
          on this page touched on creating log files of the build output. The
          redirection method shown there used the <span class=
          "command"><strong>tee</strong></span> command to redirect output to
          a file while also displaying the output to the screen. Here, the
          output will only be sent to a file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the easiest way to demonstrate the technique is to show an
          example. First, issue the command:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">ls -l /usr/bin | more</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Of course, you'll be required to view the output one page at a time
          because the <span class="command"><strong>more</strong></span>
          filter was used. Now try the same command, but this time redirect
          the output to a file. The special file <code class=
          "filename">/dev/null</code> can be used instead of the filename
          shown, but you will have no log file to examine:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class=
"command">ls -l /usr/bin | more &gt; redirect_test.log 2&gt;&amp;1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Notice that this time the command immediately returned to the shell
          prompt without having to page through the output. You may now
          remove the log file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last example will use the <span class=
          "command"><strong>yes</strong></span> command in combination with
          output redirection to bypass having to page through the output and
          then provide a <span class="keycap"><strong>y</strong></span> to a
          prompt. This technique could be used in instances when otherwise
          you would have to page through the output of a file (such as a
          license agreement) and then answer the question of <span class=
          "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">do you accept the
          above?</span>&rdquo;</span>. For this example, another short

                clean and trouble-free build, that won't have issues either
                during the build process, or at run-time. The instructions in
                the book assume these packages are installed. Some changes or
                workarounds may be required if these packages are not
                installed.

          On occasion you may run into a situation in the book when a package
          will not build or work properly. Though the Editors attempt to
          ensure that every package in the book builds and works properly,
          sometimes a package has been overlooked or was not tested with this
          particular version of BLFS.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you discover that a package will not build or work properly, you
          should see if there is a more current version of the package.
          Typically this means you go to the maintainer's web site and
          download the most current tarball and attempt to build the package.
          If you cannot determine the maintainer's web site by looking at the
          download URLs, use Google and query the package's name. For
          example, in the Google search bar type: 'package_name download'
          (omit the quotes) or something similar. Sometimes typing:
          'package_name home page' will result in you finding the
          maintainer's web site.

        </h2>
        <p>
          In LFS, stripping of debugging symbols was discussed a couple of
          times. When building BLFS packages, there are generally no special
          instructions that discuss stripping again. It is probably not a
          good idea to strip an executable or a library while it is in use,
          so exiting any windowing environment is a good idea. Then you can
          do:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">find /{,usr/}{bin,lib,sbin} \
    -type f \( -name \*.so* -a ! -name \*dbg \) \
    -exec strip --strip-unneeded {} \;</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          If you install programs in other directories such as <code class=
          "filename">/opt</code> or <code class="filename">/usr/local</code>,
          you may want to strip the files there too.
        </p>

          <a id="buildsystems" name="buildsystems"></a>Working with different
          build systems
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are now three different build systems in common use for
          converting C or C++ source code into compiled programs or libraries
          and their details (particularly, finding out about available
          options and their default values) differ. It may be easiest to
          understand the issues caused by some choices (typically slow
          execution or unexpected use of, or omission of, optimizatons) by
          starting with the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment variables. There
          are also some programs which use rust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most LFS and BLFS builders are probably aware of the basics of
          CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS for altering how a program is compiled.
          Typically, some form of optimization is used by upstream developers
          (-O2 or -O3), sometimes with the creation of debug symbols (-g), as
          defaults.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there are contradictory flags (e.g. multiple different -O
          values), the <span class="emphasis"><em>last</em></span> value will
          be used. Sometimes this means that flags specified in environment
          variables will be picked up before values hardcoded in the
          Makefile, and therefore ignored. For example, where a user
          specifies '-O2' and that is followed by '-O3' the build will use
          '-O3'.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are various other things which can be passed in CFLAGS or
          CXXFLAGS, such as forcing compilation for a specific
          microarchitecture (e.g. -march=amdfam10, -march=native) or
          specifying a specific standard for C or C++ (-std=c++17 for
          example). But one thing which has now come to light is that
          programmers might include debug assertions in their code, expecting
          them to be disabled in releases by using -DNDEBUG. Specifically, if
          <a class="xref" href="../x/mesa.html" title=
          "Mesa-19.3.4">Mesa-19.3.4</a> is built with these assertions
          enabled, some activities such as loading levels of games can take
          extremely long times, even on high-class video cards.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <a id="autotools-info" name="autotools-info"></a>Autotools with
          Make
        </h3>
        <p>
          This combination is often described as 'CMMI' (configure, make,
          make install) and is used here to also cover the few packages which
          have a configure script that is not generated by autotools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes running <span class="command"><strong>./configure
          --help</strong></span> will produce useful options about switches
          which might be used. At other times, after looking at the output
          from configure you may need to look at the details of the script to
          find out what it was actually searching for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many configure scripts will pick up any CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS from the
          environment, but CMMI packages vary about how these will be mixed
          with any flags which would otherwise be used (<span class=
          "emphasis"><em>variously</em></span>: ignored, used to replace the
          programmer's suggestion, used before the programmer's suggestion,
          or used after the programmer's suggestion).
        </p>
        <p>
          In most CMMI packages, running 'make' will list each command and
          run it, interspersed with any warnings. But some packages try to be
          'silent' and only show which file they are compiling or linking
          instead of showing the command line. If you need to inspect the
          command, either because of an error, or just to see what options
          and flags are being used, adding 'V=1' to the make invocation may
          help.

        <h3>
          <a id="cmake-info" name="cmake-info"></a>CMake
        </h3>
        <p>
          CMake works in a very different way, and it has two backends which
          can be used on BLFS: 'make' and 'ninja'. The default backend is
          make, but ninja can be faster on large packages with multiple
          processors. To use ninja, specify '-G Ninja' in the cmake command.
          However, there are some packages which create fatal errors in their
          ninja files but build successfully using the default of Unix
          Makefiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hardest part of using CMake is knowing what options you might
          wish to specify. The only way to get a list of what the package
          knows about is to run <span class="command"><strong>cmake
          -LAH</strong></span> and look at the output for that default
          configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most-important thing about CMake is that it has a
          variety of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE values, and these affect the flags. The
          default is that this is not set and no flags are generated. Any
          CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS in the environment will be used. If the
          programmer has coded any debug assertions, those will be enabled
          unless -DNDEBUG is used. The following CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE values will
          generate the flags shown, and these will come <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>after</em></span> any flags in the environment and
          therefore take precedence.

          Most released rustc programs are provided as crates (source

          are built using <span class="command"><strong>cargo

          RUSTFLAGS to change the optimize-level (default is 3, like -O3,

          Some packages default to '-O2 -g', others to '-O3 -g', and if
          CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS are supplied they might be added to the
          package's defaults, replace the package's defaults, or even be

          tuning-notes-2B.txt. The particular thing to remember is that if
          you want to try some of the more interesting flags you may need to
          force verbose builds to confirm what is being used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clearly, if you are optimizing your own program you can spend time
          to profile it and perhaps recode some of it if it is too slow. But
          for building a whole system that approach is impractical. In
          general, -O3 usually produces faster programs than -O2. Specifying
          -march=native is also beneficial, but means that you cannot move
          the binaries to an incompatible machine - this can also apply to
          newer machines, not just to older machines. For example programs
          compiled for 'amdfam10' run on old Phenoms, Kaveris, and Ryzens :
          but programs compiled for a Kaveri will not run on a Ryzen because
          certain op-codes are not present. Similarly, if you build for a
          Haswell not everything will run on a SandyBridge.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also various other options which some people claim are
          beneficial. At worst, you get to recompile and test, and then
          discover that in your usage the options do not provide a benefit.
        </p>

          If building Perl or Python modules, or Qt packages which use qmake,
          in general the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS used are those which were used
          by those 'parent' packages.

        <p>
          Even on desktop systems, there are still a lot of exploitable
          vulnerabilities. For many of these, the attack comes via javascript
          in a browser. Often, a series of vulnerabilities are used to gain
          access to data (or sometimes to pwn, i.e. own, the machine and
          install rootkits). Most commercial distros will apply various
          hardening measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          For hardening options which are reasonably cheap, there is some
          discussion in the 'tuning' link above (occasionally, one or more of
          these options might be inappropriate for a package). These options
          are -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, -fstack-protector=strong, and (for C++)
          -D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS. On modern machines these should only have a
          little impact on how fast things run, and often they will not be
          noticeable.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, there was Hardened LFS where gcc (a much older
          version) was forced to use hardening (with options to turn some of
          it off on a per-package basis. What is being covered here is
          different - first you have to make sure that the package is indeed
          using your added flags and not over-riding them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main distros use much more, such as RELRO (Relocation Read
          Only) and perhaps -fstack-clash-protection. You may also encounter
          the so-called 'userspace retpoline' (-mindirect-branch=thunk etc.)
          which is the equivalent of the spectre mitigations applied to the
          linux kernel in late 2018). The kernel mitigations caused a lot of
          complaints about lost performance, if you have a production server
          you might wish to consider testing that, along with the other
          available options, to see if performance is still sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst gcc has many hardening options, clang/LLVM's strengths lie
          elsewhere. Some options which gcc provides are said to be less
          effective in clang/LLVM, others are not available.
