          Libraries: Static or shared?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The original libraries were simply an archive of routines from
          which the required routines were extracted and linked into the
          executable program. These are described as static libraries
          (libfoo.a). On some old operating systems they are the only type
          available.
        </p>
        <p>
          On almost all Linux platforms there are also shared libraries
          (libfoo.so) - one copy of the library is loaded into virtual
          memory, and shared by all the programs which call any of its
          functions. This is space efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, essential programs such as a shell were often linked
          statically so that some form of minimal recovery system would exist
          even if shared libraries, such as libc.so, became damaged (e.g.
          moved to <code class="filename">lost+found</code> after fsck
          following an unclean shutdown). Nowadays, most people use an
          alternative system install or a Live CD if they have to recover.
          Journaling filesystems also reduce the likelihood of this sort of
          problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers, at least while they are developing, often prefer to use
          static versions of the libraries which their code links to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the book, there are various places where configure switches
          such as <span class=
          "command"><strong>--disable-static</strong></span> are employed,
          and other places where the possibility of using system versions of
          libraries instead of the versions included within another package
          is discussed. The main reason for this is to simplify updates of
          libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a package is linked to a dynamic library, updating to a newer
          library version is automatic once the newer library is installed
          and the program is (re)started (provided the library major version
          is unchanged, e.g. going from libfoo.so.2.0 to libfoo.so.2.1. Going
          to libfoo.so.3 will require recompilation - <span class=
          "command"><strong>ldd</strong></span> can be used to find which
          programs use the old version). If a program is linked to a static
          library, the program always has to be recompiled. If you know which
          programs are linked to a particular static library, this is merely
          an annoyance. But usually you will <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>not</em></span> know which programs to recompile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most libraries are shared, but if you do something unusual, such as
          moving a shared library to <code class="filename">/lib</code>
          accidentally breaking the <code class="literal">.so</code> symlink
          in <code class="filename">/usr/lib</code> while keeping the static
          library in <code class="filename">/lib</code>, the static library
          will be silently linked into the programs which need it.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way to identify when a static library is used, is to deal with
          it at the end of the installation of every package. Write a script
          to find all the static libraries in <code class=
          "filename">/usr/lib</code> or wherever you are installing to, and
          either move them to another directory so that they are no longer
          found by the linker, or rename them so that libfoo.a becomes e.g.
          libfoo.a.hidden. The static library can then be temporarily
          restored if it is ever needed, and the package needing it can be
          identified. You may choose to exclude some of the static libraries
          from glibc if you do this (<code class="filename">libc_nonshared.a,
          libg.a, libieee.a, libm.a, libpthread_nonshared.a, librpcsvc.a,
          libsupc++.a</code>) to simplify compilation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use this approach, you may discover that more packages than
          you were expecting use a static library. That was the case with
          <span class="application">nettle-2.4</span> in its default
          static-only configuration: It was required by <span class=
          "application">GnuTLS-3.0.19</span>, but also linked into package(s)
          which used <span class="application">GnuTLS</span>, such as
          <span class="application">glib-networking-2.32.3</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many packages put some of their common functions into a static
          library which is only used by the programs within the package and,
          crucially, the library is <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>not</em></span> installed as a standalone library.
          These internal libraries are not a problem - if the package has to
          be rebuilt to fix a bug or vulnerability, nothing else is linked to
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When BLFS mentions system libraries, it means shared versions of
          libraries. Some packages such as <a class="xref" href=
          "../xsoft/firefox.html" title="Firefox-68.5.0">Firefox-68.5.0</a>
          and <a class="xref" href="../pst/gs.html" title=
          "ghostscript-9.50">ghostscript-9.50</a> include many other
          libraries. When they link to them, they link statically so this
          also makes the programs bigger. The version they ship is often
          older than the version used in the system, so it may contain bugs -
          sometimes developers go to the trouble of fixing bugs in their
          included libraries, other times they do not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, deciding to use system libraries is an easy decision.
          Other times it may require you to alter the system version (e.g.
          for <a class="xref" href="../general/libpng.html" title=
          "libpng-1.6.37">libpng-1.6.37</a> if used for <a class="xref" href=
          "../xsoft/firefox.html" title="Firefox-68.5.0">Firefox-68.5.0</a>).
          Occasionally, a package ships an old library and can no longer link
          to the current version, but can link to an older version. In this
          case, BLFS will usually just use the shipped version. Sometimes the
          included library is no longer developed separately, or its upstream
          is now the same as the package's upstream and you have no other
          packages which will use it. In those cases, you might decide to use
          the included static library even if you usually prefer to use
          system libraries.
