          Conventions Used for Package Dependencies
        </h2>
        <p>
          When packages are created, the authors depend on prior work. In
          order to build a package in BLFS, these dependencies must be built
          prior to the desired package. For each package, any prerequisite
          packages are listed in one or more separate sections: Required,
          Recommended, and Optional.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Required Dependencies
        </h3>
        <p>
          These dependencies are the minimum prerequisite packages required
          to build the package. Omitted from the list are packages in LFS and
          required dependencies of other required packages.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Recommended Dependencies
        </h3>
        <p>
          These dependencies are those that the BLFS editors have determined
          are important to give the package reasonable capabilities. Package
          installation instructions assume they are installed. If a
          recommended package is not desired, the instructions may need to be
          modified to accommodate the missing package.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Optional Dependencies
        </h3>
        <p>
          These dependencies are those that the package may use. Integration
          of optional dependencies may be automatic by the package or may
          need additional instructions not presented by BLFS. Optional
          packages may be listed without corresponding BLFS instructions. In
          this case it is up to the user to determine appropriate
          installation instructions.

          Conventions Used for Kernel Configuration Options
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some packages have specific needs regarding the kernel
          configuration. The general layout is the following:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">Master section ---&gt;
  Subsection ---&gt;
    [*]     Required parameter                     [CONFIG_REQU_PAR]
    &lt;*&gt;     Required parameter (not as module)     [CONFIG_REQU_PAR_NMOD]
    &lt;*/M&gt;   Required parameter (could be a module) [CONFIG_REQU_PAR_MOD]
    &lt;*/M/ &gt; Optional parameter                     [CONFIG_OPT_PAR]
    [ ] Incompatible parameter                     [CONFIG_INCOMP_PAR]
    &lt; &gt; Incompatible parameter (even as module)    [CONFIG_INCOMP_PAR_MOD]</code>
</pre>
        <p>
          [CONFIG_...] on the right gives the name of the option, so you can
          easily check whether it is set in your <code class=

          SBU values in BLFS
        </h2>
        <p>
          As in LFS, each package in BLFS has a build time listed in Standard
          Build Units (SBUs). These times are relative to the time it took to
          build binutils in LFS and are intended to provide some insight into
          how long it will take to build a package. Most times listed are for
          a single processor or core to build the package. In some cases,
          large, long running builds tested on multi-core systems have SBU
          times listed with comments such as '(parallelism=4)'. These values
          indicate testing was done using multiple cores. Note that while
          this speeds up the build on systems with the appropriate hardware,
          the speedup is not linear and to some extent depends on the
          individual package and specific hardware used.
        </p>
        <p>
          For packages which use ninja (e.g. anything using meson) or rust,
          by default all cores are used so similar comments will be seen on
          such packages even when the build time is minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where even a parallel build takes more than 15 SBU, on certain
          machines the time may be considerably greater even when the build
          does not use swap. In particular, different micro-architectures
          will build some files at different relative speeds and this can
          introduce delays when certain make targets wait for another file to
          be created. Where a large build uses a lot of C++ files, processors
          with Simultaneous Multi Threading will share the Floating Point
          Unit and can take 45% longer than when using four 'prime' cores
          (measured on an intel i7 using taskset and keeping the other cores
          idle).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some packages do not support parallel builds and using -j1 for the
          make command is required. Packages that are known to have such
          limits are marked as such in the text.
