          About vulnerabilities
        </h2>
        <p>
          All software has bugs. Sometimes, a bug can be exploited, for
          example to allow users to gain enhanced privileges (perhaps gaining
          a root shell, or simply accessing or deleting other user's files),
          or to allow a remote site to crash an application (denial of
          service), or for theft of data. These bugs are labelled as
          vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main place where vulnerabilities get logged is <a class="ulink"
          href="http://cve.mitre.org">cve.mitre.org</a>. Unfortunately, many
          vulnerability numbers (CVE-yyyy-nnnn) are initially only labelled
          as "reserved" when distributions start issuing fixes. Also, some
          vulnerabilities apply to particular combinations of <span class=
          "command"><strong>configure</strong></span> options, or only apply
          to old versions of packages which have long since been updated in
          BLFS.
        </p>
        <p>
          BLFS differs from distributions&mdash;there is no BLFS security
          team, and the editors only become aware of vulnerabilities after
          they are public knowledge. Sometimes, a package with a
          vulnerability will not be updated in the book for a long time.
          Issues can be logged in the Trac system, which might speed up
          resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The normal way for BLFS to fix a vulnerability is, ideally, to
          update the book to a new fixed release of the package. Sometimes
          that happens even before the vulnerability is public knowledge, so
          there is no guarantee that it will be shown as a vulnerability fix
          in the Changelog. Alternatively, a <span class=
          "command"><strong>sed</strong></span> command, or a patch taken
          from a distribution, may be appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bottom line is that you are responsible for your own security,
          and for assessing the potential impact of any problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep track of what is being discovered, you may wish to follow
          the security announcements of one or more distributions. For
          example, Debian has <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.debian.org/security">Debian security</a>. Fedora's
          links on security are at <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security">the Fedora wiki</a>.
          Details of Gentoo linux security announcements are discussed at
          <a class="ulink" href="https://security.gentoo.org">Gentoo
          security</a>. Finally, the Slackware archives of security
          announcements are at <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://slackware.com/security">Slackware security</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most general English source is perhaps <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure">the Full Disclosure Mailing
          List</a>, but please read the comment on that page. If you use
          other languages you may prefer other sites such as <a class="ulink"
          href="http://www.heise.de/security">heise.de</a> (German) or
          <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cert.hr">cert.hr</a> (Croatian).
          These are not linux-specific. There is also a daily update at
          lwn.net for subscribers (free access to the data after 2 weeks, but
          their vulnerabilities database at <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://lwn.net/Vulnerabilities/">lwn.net/Vulnerabilities</a> is
          unrestricted).
        </p>
        <p>
          For some packages, subscribing to their 'announce' lists will
          provide prompt news of newer versions.
