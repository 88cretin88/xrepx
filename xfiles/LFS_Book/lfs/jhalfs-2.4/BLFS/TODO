--   Review generated scripts for bugs trying to figure out if are due fails
     in the BLFS book XML tagging (that will implied that the book need be
     fixed) or are required variations due book layout. If the latter, try
     to fix it via XSL, documenting in README.BLFS that issues that can't be
     fixed.

     This is an on-going and never-end task due that, ideally, each commit to
     the BLFS book should be revised and validated, but our time is limited.

--   Bugs hunting.
